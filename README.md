## Project Goal:
The mission is to build a command-line tool using Python that can fetch and display the current weather for any city in the world. I will have to write a script that interacts with a real-world web service (an API) to get live data and present it in a user-friendly way in the terminal.

Learning Objectives:
By completing this project, I will gain practical experience with:
 * Making API requests to a web service.
 * Using a major third-party Python library (requests).
 * Parsing and handling data in the standard JSON format.
 * Taking and processing user input.
 * Implementing robust error handling to make your application resilient.

Estimated Time: Approximately 9-10 hours

Crucial First Step: Getting Your API Key
This project requires a personal "API Key" to access the weather data. You will get this from OpenWeatherMap
